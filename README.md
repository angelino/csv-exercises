# CSV Exercises

## Round 1

Simple exercises using a very small data set. Each exercise includes a CSV file, and the problem will be solved using two objects: One that represents a single _thing_, a single row of data, and a second object that manages the collection of those things.

### PhoneBook

Follow [the step-by-step tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/intro_to_csv.html) to get a feel for how we are solving the problem.

If you want to look at the completed code and tests, they're in the directory named `phone_book_solved`.

### Follow-On Exercises

The exercises should be solved in the following order:

* ShoppingList
* ReportCard
* DoctorsOffice
* Calendar

Each exercise leaves more and more up to you.

## Round 2

Add more data, more attributes, and do computation based on attributes (search, aggregate)
